# A Psych Thing

As a proffesional AP Psychologist, it is **imperative** I boast about my shallow research in such a deep subject simply because I got a 5 on the already "made for the dumb" AP Psych Exam. But here, I will go and attempt to extrapolate many things about our minds, stating and noting down some phenomena I've noticed after realizing the complexity of our heads.

## Imagination

Many of us possess the uncanny ability to imagine things. Shocker. But are there limits? Yes... I think. Here's my first phenomenon, the fact, that we cannot imagine a face we have not seen before. Any face we imagine, we have seen before, and have added it into a catalougue of faces, all organized by their traits. You want to imagine a tanned boy with golden hair and green eyes, you brain runs a very large scan and pops up an image that best fits the criteria. 
But what if you took a pre-existing face, and warped it? What if you imagined Kylie Jenner, but her warped her nose so that it turns 90 degrees to right and has flaring nostrils? You could probably do that? Right?
**BUT YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN A KYLIE JENNER WITH A 90 DEGREE NOSE AND INCH BIG NOSTRILS**
Have I just beat the system? (⊙_⊙)？Maybe, I dunno, I'm here to talk about things, not prove them.

Secondly, what if we try to imagine too much? Imagine a field of grass. A mediocre plot of green land. Now, really, focus, tune out all noise and stop moving. Really imagine this. Now try to pin point every single blade of grass within that plot of field, without losing the image of the entire field. It may help to imagine on blade of grass really nicely, and then "zoom out". Can you do it? Okay, now what if you try to identify each fiber of the grass? How much precision can you add into this image, until your mind stops trying?
More importantly, why does it stop trying? Does it lack bandwidth or GPU power, but like Biological? Eh I dunno.
